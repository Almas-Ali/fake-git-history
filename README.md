## Options and Usage

### `--commit-per-day` and `-c`

Specify the number of commits to be created for each day.
The default value is `0-3`, which means it will randomly generate from 0 to 3 commits per day. For example, to generate commits randomly between 6 and 12 per day, you can do:

```bash
fake-git-history --commit-per-day "6-12"
# or
fake-git-history -c "6-12"
```

You can also give a strict number. For example, you need 16 contributions every single day. Then use this command. Not recommended, this will make views to easily detect your bot.

```bash
fake-git-history --commit-per-day "16"
# or
fake-git-history -c "16"
```

### `--work-days-only` and `-d`

Use this option if you don't want to commit on weekends. Example:

```bash
fake-git-history --work-days-only
# or
fake-git-history -d
```

### `--weekends-only` and `-w`

Use this option if you only want to contribute on weekends. Example:

```bash
fake-git-history --weekends-only
# or
fake-git-history -w
```

### `--start-date` and `--end-date` or `-s` and `-e`

The starting data is by default set to previous 90 days from the current date and end date is by default present date. If you don't change, it will create commits for the last 90 days. You can change the start date and end date. Example:

```bash
# Strict end date
fake-git-history --start-date "01/03/2016" --endDate "12/02/2023"
# or
fake-git-history -s "01/03/2016" -e "12/02/2023"

# Flexible end date
fake-git-history --start-date "01/03/2016"
# or
fake-git-history -s "01/03/2016"
```

The date formating is `DD/MM/YYYY`. You have to write this way.

### `--auto-git-push` and `-a`

Use this option to automatically push the commits to the remote repository. Example:

```bash
fake-git-history --auto-git-push
# or
fake-git-history -a
```

### `--verbose` and `-vv`

Use this option to see the verbose output. Without this option you won't be able to see much information about the process. Example:

```bash
fake-git-history --verbose
# or
fake-git-history -vv
```

### `--version` and `-v`

Use this option to check the version of this script.

```bash
fake-git-history --version
# or
fake-git-history -v
```

### `--help` and `-h`

You can always refer to this help menu to see the options available. Example:

```bash
fake-git-history --help
```

**Output**

```bash
usage: fake-git-history [-h] [--start-date START_DATE] [--end-date END_DATE] [--work-days-only] [--weekends-only] [--commit-per-day COMMIT_PER_DAY] [--auto-git-push] [--verbose] [--version]

## PS

This tool was created as a joke, so please don't take it seriously. While cheating is never encouraged, if someone is judging your professional skills based on your GitHub activity graph, they deserve to see a rich activity graph ðŸ¤“
